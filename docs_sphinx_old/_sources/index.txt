CanlabCore documentation home
=============================

The CANlab Core Tools package is a set of Matlab functions that are designed
to serve miscellaneous purposes. Many of them have stand-alone command line
function, but the toolbox also contains functions that are used in other
CANlab toolboxes, and so this package should be downloaded and put on the
Matlab path when using any of the toolboxes.
